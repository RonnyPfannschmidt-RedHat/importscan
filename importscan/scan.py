def scan(package, ignore=None, onerror=None):
    """Scan a package by importing it.

    A framework can provide registration decorators: a decorator that
    when used on a class or a function causes it to be registered with
    the framework. Metaclasses can also be used for this effect. As a
    consequence of this, registration only takes place when the module
    is actually imported. You can do this import explicitly in your
    code.  It can however also be convenient to import everything in a
    package all at once automatically. This is what ``scan`` does.

    This function was extracted and refactored from the ``Venusian``
    library which also provides infrastructure for finding such
    decorators.

    :param package: A reference to a Python package or module object.

    :param ignore: Ignore certain modules or packages during a scan. It
      should be a sequence containing strings and/or callables that
      are used to match against the dotted name of a module
      encountered during a scan. The sequence can contain any of these
      three types of objects:

      - A string representing a dotted name. For example, if you want
        to ignore the ``my.package`` package *and any of its
        submodules* during the scan, pass
        ``ignore=['my.package']``.

      - A string representing a relative dotted name. To name an
        object relative to the ``package`` passed to this method, use
        a string beginning with a dot. For example, if the ``package``
        you've passed is imported as ``my.package``, and you pass
        ``ignore=['.mymodule']``, the ``my.package.mymodule`` mymodule
        *and any of its submodules* are omitted during scan
        processing.

      - A callable that accepts a dotted name indicating a module or a
        package as its single positional argument and returns ``True``
        or ``False``. For example, if you want to skip all packages and
        modules with a full dotted path that ends
        with the word "tests", you can use
        ``ignore=[re.compile('tests$').search]``. If the callable
        returns ``True`` (or anything else truthy), the object is
        ignored, if it returns ``False`` (or anything else falsy) the
        object is not ignored.

        *Note that unlike string matches, ignores that use a callable
        don't cause submodules of a package represented by a dotted
        name to also be ignored, they match individual modules and packages
        found during a scan*.

      You can mix and match the three types of strings in the list.
      For example, if the package being scanned is ``my``,
      ``ignore=['my.package', '.someothermodule',
      re.compile('tests$').search]`` would cause ``my.package`` (and
      all its submodules and subobjects) to be ignored,
      ``my.someothermodule`` to be ignored, and any modules, packages,
      or global objects found during the scan that have a full dotted
      name that ends with the word ``tests`` to be ignored.

      Packages and modules matched by any ignore in the list are not
      imported, and their top-level (registration) code is not run as
      a result.

      You can also pass in a string or callable by itself as a single
      non-list argument.

    :param onerror: A callback function which behaves the same way as the
      ``onerror`` callback function described in
      http://docs.python.org/library/pkgutil.html#pkgutil.walk_packages
      .  By default scan propagates all errors that happen during its
      code importing process, including :exc:`ImportError`. If you
      use a custom ``onerror`` callback, you can change this behavior.

      Here's an example ``onerror`` callback that ignores
      :exc:`ImportError`::

        import sys
        def onerror(name):
            if not issubclass(sys.exc_info()[0], ImportError):
                raise # reraise the last exception

      The ``name`` passed to ``onerror`` is the module or package
      dotted name that could not be imported due to an exception.
